# Stock-Prediction
The "Stock-Prediction" repository implements an AI neural network model for predicting stock prices. The project leverages historical stock patterns to forecast future stock prices accurately.
  
  The code utilizes the Keras library to build a sequential model consisting of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, which are well-suited for analyzing sequential data. The model is trained on a dataset of historical stock prices and then used to make predictions on unseen data.
  
  This project serves as a foundation for developing more advanced stock prediction models and can be extended to include additional features like sentiment analysis, technical indicators, or fundamental data to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions.
